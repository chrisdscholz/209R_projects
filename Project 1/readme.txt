Do US cities generally experience the most sunny weather in the June/July summer months? Given that the geographic location of the continental US is solidly in the northern hemisphere, one would likely imagine that US cities experience their highest number of sunshine hours in the northern hemisphere summer months - i.e. June and July. Days stretch longer and nights shorter in summer months, which is only more pronounced the further you get from the equator. Assuming this equates to more sunshine in peak summer months for US cities, can we see this quantitatively in our climate data?

To answer this question, we performed a number of transformation and visualization tasks on our dataset. Initially, we sketched a rough layout for our visual, deciding to use a line chart with the months as the x-axis and percentage of annual sunshine as the y-axis. This would allow for us to easily see the trend across an entire annual period. We also decided to encode the cities as different colored lines on the plot, so we could visualize each city separately.

Next, we worked on transforming our dataset. Unneeded fields were dropped, and we calculated a “percentage of annual sunshine” metric by totaling annual sunshine per city, and then dividing each city’s monthly measurement by that annual total. The point was not to see which cities have the most sunshine as compared to each other, but to determine when each city experiences the most sunshine throughout the year, relative to its own sunshine totals. By creating this percentage of annual sunshine metric, it makes our cities more easily comparable for the purposes of answering our question.

Lastly, we put everything together as a plot line. To add some further clarity, we introduced a box shape to better visualize when the peak summer months occur (i.e. June/July), and we also created a couple annotations to note interesting features. So getting back to our question - do US cities generally experience the most sunny weather in the June/July summer months? The answer appears to be yes, generally (at least for the six cities sampled). Our visualization did produce a few fascinating insights. First, while most cities did see drastically more sunny weather in the summer, a couple (San Diego, Miami) saw relatively lower summer increases. This makes sense looking at the data, given that these locales feature only mild swings in sunshine seasonally. However, perhaps most striking was San Francisco. Not only did San Francisco buck the trend and not produce sunshine highs in June/July, it actually produced sunshine lows in these months! Interestingly, San Francisco experiences the most sunshine from January through March, which is vastly different than the other US cities sampled. I would imagine this is due to other weather factors, like geography and pacific ocean weather, but diving into that is outside the scope of our initial question. Overall our visualization was a success in helping answer our question and derive further insight from the dataset.
